# Retinal Blood Vessel Segmentation

Retinal Blood Vessel Segmentation by using some basic Computer Vision techniques.

## Overview

The segmentation of blood vessels from retinal images is an important and challenging task in medical analysis and diagnosis.

In this project, I have implemented an algorithm for the Retinal Blood Vessel Segmentation task with the use of Computer Vision techniques.

Stages of the work include:
* Extracting green channel and gray-scale image
* Contrast Enhancement
* Excluding Background
* Thresholding
* Removing objects with less than 35 white pixels
* Combinig gray-scale and green channel

## Usage

Just run runner.m file by using Matlab.

## Results
The accuracy of the work is measured by Sensitivity, Specificity, and Accuracy. See the Resuls.xls file.
